CSS(Cascading style sheets) is the skin of the website. It is used for styling the website and making it trustworthy in the eyes of the user, since websites with older or non-existant CSS is generaly regarded as sketchy. Due to it's likns with HTML, the language is quite popular with developers.

Thhe language works via asserting difrent values to properties of an element(the tag name).

Keep in mind however that tha language is cascading, meaning that it only apleys the last value to the property unles sepcified otherwise. This can get anoying, but is solveable through asserting a class or id in the element tag.

The language works with asserting difrent values(yellow) to properties(color) of an element(h1). 

![alternative text]( /assets/img/img_selector.png )

Keep in mind that the language is cascading, meanign that the language aplies the last given value of the same propertie. In order to avoid this, you can cal the same element but with a unique class or ID. With there being a higharchy of ID:s on top, classes in the middle, and elements on the botom.

For example: 

![alternative text]( /assets/img/comparison1.png ) leades to ![alternative text]( /assets/img/result1.png )

Wearas pointing to the class of the element like ![alternative text]( /assets/img/comparison2.png ) leades to ![alternative text]( /assets/img/result2.png )

Finaly, the style is linked to the html page through whrighting {% highlight ruby %}
"<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">"{% endhighlight %}. This will apply the wanted styles to the elements.
