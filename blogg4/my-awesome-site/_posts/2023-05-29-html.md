HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the skeleton of a website, and without it the website simply would not exist. It is used to structure the website itself in a manner that is clear and logical for the user, so that they can use the website withoud confusion.

The website is also popular due to it's simple easy to learn syntax, as well as it's easy interaction with CSS and Javascript. The language is build up by tags that display the element and it's properties, the content and a closing tag.

There will att first be 3 tags: {% highlight ruby %}<html>{% endhighlight %} for the website,{% highlight ruby %}<head>{% endhighlight %} for metadata(imported style and scripts, and settings for the website), and  {% highlight ruby %}<Body>{% endhighlight %} to whright your content in 
{% highlight ruby %}

<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
